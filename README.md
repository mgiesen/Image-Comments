## Description

The `Image Comments` extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to add images, such as sketches or diagrams, directly into your source code. This helps to improve documentation and understanding, especially for complex algorithms. By visualizing code concepts, it makes them easier to comprehend and track over time.

## Features

- Hover over comments to display custom images in a tooltip
- Simple syntax for linking images in comments
- Option to open images directly within the editor
- Option to scale images for better overview

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.60.0 or higher

## Usage

- Place your image in a folder that is accessible relative to the source file you are working on.
- Insert a standard comment into your code.
- Append the relative image path, starting from the current file's folder, enclosed in square brackets to the comment.
- The image can be located in the same folder, a subfolder, or a parent folder of the current file.
- Hover over the comment to view the image directly within your IDE.

Javascript Examples:

```javascript
// If the image is in the same folder [image.png]

// If the image is in a subfolder [images/image.png]

// If the image is in a parent folder [../image.png]
```

Python Example:

```Python
# Functional comment [image-comments/image1.png]
```

SQL Example:

```sql
-- Functional comment [image-comments/image1.png]
```

## Limitations

Due to the limitations of Visual Studio Code, it is not possible to display images directly in the code. Therefore, this extension uses the solution of visualization via tooltips. The usage and styling of tooltips are also severely restricted. We do our best to always utilize all possibilities provided by Microsoft.
