## Description

The `Image Comments` extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to add images, such as sketches or diagrams, directly into your source code. This helps to improve documentation and understanding, especially for complex algorithms. By visualizing code concepts, it makes them easier to comprehend and track over time.

## Features

- Hover over comments to display custom images in a tooltip
- Simple syntax for linking images in comments
- Option to open images directly within the editor
- Option to scale images for better overview
- Configurable image path mode: relative to the file or the workspace

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.60.0 or higher

## Usage

- Place your image in a folder that is accessible relative to the source file you are working on.
- Insert a comment into your code using the appropriate comment syntax for your programming language.
- Append the relative image path, starting from the current file's folder, enclosed in square brackets `[]` within the comment.
- The image can be located in the same folder, a subfolder, or a parent folder of the current file.
- Hover over the comment to view the image directly in the tooltip within your IDE.
- The extension supports both single-line and multi-line comments in various programming languages.
- Configure whether image paths are relative to the file or the workspace via the `imageComments.pathMode` setting.

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
// Image in the same folder [image.png]

// Image in a subfolder [images/image.png]

// Image in a parent folder [../image.png]

/*
   You can also use multi-line comments [../image.png]
*/
```

## Configuration

- **`imageComments.pathMode`** (default: `relativeToFile`)
  - `relativeToFile`: Image paths in comments are interpreted as relative to the file.
  - `relativeToWorkspace`: Image paths in comments are interpreted as relative to the workspace.

To modify this setting, open VS Code settings (`Ctrl + ,`), search for `imageComments.pathMode`, and choose your preferred option.

## Limitations

Due to the limitations of Visual Studio Code, it is not possible to display images directly in the code. Therefore, this extension uses the solution of visualization via tooltips. The usage and styling of tooltips are also severely restricted. We do our best to always utilize all possibilities provided by Microsoft.
